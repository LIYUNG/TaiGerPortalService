It also offers the opportunity for individual specialization in one or more subject areas.\\nThe aptitude assessment for the M.Sc. Informatics is a two-stage process in which we assess your qualification with regard to the special qualitative requirements of this Master\\'s program.\\nApplication Periods\\nWinter semester: 01 February - 31 May\\nSummer semester: 01 September - 30 November\\nHow do I apply?\\nYou have to apply for the Master\\'s degree via TUMonline.\\xa0After you have created your account in TUMonline, enter personal data and information about your education, and upload the required documents. The application is done completely electronically.\\nProspective students with a Bachelor\\'s degree from outside the European Union have to request a preliminary examination documentation from uni-assist (VPD) in advance.\\nOnly in case of admission, you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies for the enrollment.\\nApplication for a Master\\'s program - step by step\\nWhich documents do I need to submit with my application?\\nThe following documents have to be submitted for the application (the required documents may vary depending on the applicant): A statement of reasons explaining why you have chosen this master’s program and TUM specifically (max. 2 pages) Your CV/résumé A scientific essay of approx. 1,000 words on a specified topic (see below) Form \"Analysis of the Curriculum\" (see below) Bachelor\\'s degree certificate, including a list of courses and grades OR an official transcript of records. Documents not issued in German or English must be translated and notarized by a sworn translator. Curriculum (module descriptions, course catalog or syllabus) of the underlying university degree Proof of your\\xa0English language proficiency GRE or Gate score for applicants with a B.Sc. degree from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Pakistan (original scorecard or have the score transmitted directly via ETS) Preliminary documentation from uni-assist\\xa0for all applicants with a Bachelor\\'s degree from outside the EU/EEA APS certificate\\xa0for applicants with a Bachelor\\'s from China, Vietnam or India Certificates from professional training or additional qualifications related to the program (e.g. participation in research competitions, internships, etc.) (not mandatory) A passport photo A copy of your passport International applicants:\\nAttention:\\xa0If you did not obtain your Bachelor\\'s degree in a country within the EU/EEA, you have to upload a\\xa0preliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD). In order to get the VPD, you must send the required documents (some as notarized copies!) to uni-assist via post! Uni-assist still needs the documents in paper. As the issuance of the VPD can take up to 4 weeks, we highly recommend sending the necessary documents to uni-assist very early. More information on Preliminary Documentation (VPD) by uni-assist.\\nPlease do check the\\xa0requirements for Notarization, especially for translations! Special requirements for documents apply for certain countries.\\nThe admission office checks if your uploaded documents are complete and correct. When this is the case, the department can access your application and forward it to the admission committee. The admission committee will decide whether your application is admitted, rejected or processed to the second stage of the aptitude assessment.\\nWhat do I have to consider if I come from abroad? (VPD, GRE, APS)?\\nPreliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD)\\nApplicants who did not obtain their qualification for postgraduate studies (usually a bachelor\\'s degree) in a country within the EU/EEA must apply for a preliminary documentation (VPD) from uni-assist, additionally to the TUM application.\\nWhat documents must be submitted to uni-assist? Filled-in application form for VPD (see Downloads) a copy of your degree certificate (if available) a copy of your transcript of records a translation, given that the original documents have not been issued in either German or English if necessary: Certificate of the German Evaluation Center (APS) You don\\'t have to submit an entire application for a specific program to uni-assist, you only have to apply for the general preliminary documentation (VPD).\\nAn application for a VPD via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at TUM.\\nGRE and GATE\\nApplicants with a Degree from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran or Pakistan have to submit a GRE (General) Test. We have defined required minimum scores, lower scores will not be accepted!\\nThe required scores are: Verbal reasoning: (will not be taken into account anymore) Quantitative reasoning: 164 Analytical writing: 4.0 The Institution Code: 7806, Department: 5199 (\"all other departments\").\\nAlternatively, students can submit a scorecard of the Indian GATE test (Computer Science; for M.Sc. CSE the Mechanical Engineering Test will also be accepted). The minimal qualifying score of the respective year is necessary.\\nCertificate from the German Evaluation Center (Akademischen Prüfstelle, APS)\\nApplicants with an undergraduate degree from China, India and Vietnam have to submit a certificate from the German Evaluation Center (APS).\\nQualification Requirements and Assessment Process\\nStudents with a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics / Computer Science which is equivalent to the B.Sc. Informatics taught at TUM are eligible to apply. Other programs do not qualify for this Master\\'s degree.\\nApplicants also have to provide a proof of sufficient English language proficiency.\\nOverview assessment process:\\nOverview assessment process for the M.Sc.
