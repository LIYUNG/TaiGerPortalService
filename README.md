# TaiGer Portal

# How to use?
TaiGer Portal is running on Node.js. Make sure you already have Node environment and do not forget the package manager npm.\
In order to run TaiGer Portal on the localhost, one terminal should run backend server (make sure MongoDB is available as it will connect MongoDB and open the port) while another run frontend server.

## Important Librariby version
* Nodejs v18
* MongoDB v5.9

## Run Backend Server
### Installation all packages needed for backend server:
```
cd api
npm install
```
### Backend setup 

**Enviornment setup**
- copy `.env.sample` to `.env.production`, `.env.development`, `.env.test` and fill in the values

**Install Mongo DB**
Before running backend server, make sure you have install MongoDB as database in your machine. 

MacOS: [Youtube-Install a local MongoDB Database on macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwVOIRX3VXk)
```
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.4 # version 4.4
```
```
brew service start monodb-community@4.4 # start the mongodb as a service
```
**Create Key and Pem file**

MacOs: [Youtube - Create Your Own SSL Certificate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR4_YISXNZE)

The following code will generate the key and 
```
cd api/cert
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert.key -out cert.pem -config req.cnf -sha256
```
After this step, you should have 
* cert.key
* cert.pem 

within the cert folder. Do not worry, in the .gitignore it will not commit your certifications into github :)

### Run the following commands to run Development code:
```
cd api
npm run-script dev
```
or the following for Production code:
```
cd api
npm run-script start
```
# API Documentation
Run the following commands to get the all response type documentation of each API:
```
cd api/doc
npm start
```

# Notes
- the `UPLOAD_PATH` in `.env.test` will be deleted whenever the test is run, be careful not to share the value with other `.env` files

# Note:
- [x] fill missing fields in `api/.env.sample`


# Debug
## MacOS
* Change your client/package.json

Instead of set, change to **export**  [How to specify a port to run a react-app](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40714583/how-to-specify-a-port-to-run-a-create-react-app-based-project)
```
 "scripts": {
    "start": "export PORT=3006 && react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```
## Backend 
If you open backend first time at Chrome, you need to go to https://localhost:3000/ and set it as safe manually.
